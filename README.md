### My personal website as a Nuxt.js application, written in TypeScript and based on Material Design. ###

Actually, yet another attempt to develop my personal website, to be precise...

> *... I'm pretty sure this is the fifth one...* 😒

---

This website will simply be a *"place"* where I'll be able to share my thoughts with all of you, where everyone will be able to get to know me and my interests and *-why not?-* learn new interesting things! 😉

At last but not least, this website will be:

* My landing page.
* My blog.
* My portfolio.
* My curriculum vitae.
* My blackboard.
* *... and some other "my-" exciting things!* 🤣
